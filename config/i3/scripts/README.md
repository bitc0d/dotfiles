##### i3-style #####
Just call i3-style with the name of the theme you want to try and where you want to write the config file to. i3-style will look for your config in the default place and apply the theme.

i3-style solarized -o ~/.config/i3/config --reload

Check the themes directory for the list of built-in themes.

i3-style ~/.config/i3/solarized.yaml -o ~/.config/i3/config

Just keep doing that until you get it perfect (which might be never).
